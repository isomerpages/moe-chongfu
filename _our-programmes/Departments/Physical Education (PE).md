<h3><strong>PE Department (Programmes)</strong></h3>

<h5><strong>Introduction</strong></h5>

<p style="text-align:justify"><b>“The purpose of physical education is to enable students to demonstrate individually and with others the physical skills, practices, and values to enjoy a lifetime of active, healthy living.”</b> (adapted from PE syllabus 2014)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Aligning to the PE syllabus 2014, Chongfu school emphasises on movement education and educate the child through the following 3 modes:</p>

*   Education in movement
*   Education through movement; and
*   Education about movement

<p style="text-align:justify">With movement education, students will acquire fundamental motor skills and movement concepts which lay a strong foundation in learning sports related skills. With the emphasis on application in developmentally appropriate physical activities and sport, students will be competent in their skills and be intrinsically motivated to take part in physical activities. This developmental approach allows students to experience success in physical activities and adopt an active lifestyle from young. Lifelong learning will then be achieved when students continue to be active in their adulthood.</p>

<h5><strong>Programmes</strong></h5>

<p style="text-align:justify">When designing the school’s PE department programme, the PE and CCA department is strongly guided by inclusivity. With the guiding principle of inclusivity, students’ mass participation is the key area of focus for our department.</p>

<label for="accordion1"><b>Games Day/ Lower Primary Games Day (LPGD)</b></label>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p style="text-align:justify">The Games Day and the LPGD provide platforms for our students to be physically active. Activities during the Games Day and LPGD were designed to allow mass participation and for students to apply their learning during the PE lessons in a game setting. Guided by inclusivity, these games were non-competitive in nature and hence providing the necessary platforms for inculcating values and character building. The LPGD was also carried out this year as a form of talent identification programme for the P2 students. In the midst of having fun, P2 students are also being talent scouted and parents are made known to of their child’s potential. This also helps parents to make a more informed choice with regards their child’s CCA selection for the following year.</p>

<label for="accordion2"><b>SHHK Combined Sports Meet</b></label>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p style="text-align:justify">This is an annual event to allow our athletes to compete with our 4 other Hokkien Huay Kuan Schools, namely, Tao Nan School, Ai Tong School, Kong Hwa School and Nan Chiau Primary School. The event also serves to forge better ties among the staff and students from the 5 schools as everyone works&nbsp;together to make the event a success.</p>

<label for="accordion3"><b>Camp iNspire P1 to P6</b></label>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p style="text-align:justify">From the initial format of a P5 Camp, the Camp iNspire programme has been undergoing constant expansion since 2005, involving children at more and more levels to build life skills and resilience. At 2007, camps were organised for Primary 4, 5 and 6 pupils. In 2008, Camp iNspire was extended to Primary 1 to Primary 3. Each camp focuses on different aspects of character development and incorporates Social Emotional Learning (SEL) components. The format and activities of the camps were also closely guided by the Outdoor Adventure framework as stated in the PE syllabus 2014.</p>

<p><b>P6 Camp iNspire 2022</b></p>

<p><b>Camp Theme : Relationship Management</b></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">For our Primary Six cohort who have missed out on major in-person activities for the last two years due to Covid-19 restrictions, Camp iNspire was certainly an event which they looked forward to. Through Camp iNspire, the school hopes to nurture healthy, active and confident students through outdoor education. On 22 and 23 June 2022 of the June Holidays, our students returned to school for supplementary lessons in the morning before attending the half-day non-residential camp in the afternoon.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">In the spirit of Camp iNspire being an adventure learning programme, our graduating cohort was introduced to Dragon Boating and the theme of the camp hinges on Relationship Management. It was a fun-filled afternoon spent at the Singapore Dragon Boat Association as students familiarised themselves with basic commands and picked up paddling strokes that allow them to work in their teams. Exhilaration was written all over their faces as many of the students were experiencing dragon boating for the very first time.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">This annual event brings home to the students the message of the importance of living an active life. P4 to P6 pupils look forward to the event and start training early in the year in preparation for the run. This in turn helps to keep them fit and healthy.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">As part of a strategic move to develop our niches in Aesthetics and Sports, Chongfu started MCP in 1999 to incorporate dance lessons as part of the PE curriculum in Primary 1. Today, MCP has evolved to numerous specialized programmes in areas of Aesthetics and Sports. Through the MCPs, students with strong potential are identified to join additional training to groom them further.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p style="text-align:justify">SwimSafer is a national water safety programme in Singapore introduced in July 2010 by the National Water Safety Council (NWSC), a council appointed by the then Ministry of Community, Youth and Sports (MCYS). In 2013, NWSC transferred full ownership of SwimSafer to Sport Singapore. The swimsafer programme consists of 6 progressive stages and caters to all students regardless of their swimming proficiency and is open up to all the P3 students.</p>
