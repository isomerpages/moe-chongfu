</p>
<p>and thereby preparing them for the 21st century.</p>

<h3><strong>CCE Learning Outcomes</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify">CCE is central to the 21st Century Competencies Framework. It emphasizes the interconnectedness of the core values, social and emotional competencies and civic literacy, global awareness and cross-cultural skills that are critical for character and citizenship development of our students.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The learning outcomes of CCE state what we want our students to learn and attain in CCE, and guide the development of the curriculum for CCE.</p>

<p><strong>CCE Lessons</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">CCE Lessons These lessons which include CCE Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP), CCE Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) and Programme for Active Learning (PAL) provide the time for teachers to engage and build relationships with their students through discussions and effective classroom strategies. In addition to the syllabus of character and citizenship education, the school aims to equip students with relevant life skills to help them deal effectively with demands and challenges of their everyday life. The life skills lessons provide basic tips to help them develop their personal growth across P1 to P6 levels in the following areas:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li><p>Social &amp; Mental Health</p></li>
<li><p>Coping with Changes</p></li>
<li><p>Study Skills</p></li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align:justify">Teachers as Character Coaches lead students in reflecting and discussing relevant issues and scenarios. Students record their reflections which include knowledge and skills learnt in their FTGP journals and CCE Values Education Package.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>CCE Lessons (Mother Tongue)</strong>
<br>CCE Lessons (Mother Tongue) focuses on developing the moral and social well-being of our pupils by helping them acquire and live by the values that guide them to make appropriate decisions. It not only plays a critical role in instilling sound moral values in our pupils so that they will be equipped with knowledge and life skills, it also nurtures them with the correct attitudes so that they will develop into morally upright, caring and responsible individuals and citizens.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Our school has been worked with SHHK Education committee and the other 4 SHHK (Primary) schools to jointly develop lesson package using SHHK graded storybooks to extend and reinforce teaching points aligned with the philosophy of our SHHK’s founder, Mr Tan Kah Kee, whilst maintaining the CCE (MT) syllabus/curriculum that espoused the R3ICH values, namely Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Caring and Harmony.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Education and Career Guidance</strong>
<br>Education and Career Guidance (ECG) helps students develop a sense of purpose in life. By nurturing self-awareness and self-directedness for lifelong learning, ECG helps students develop a growth mindset, adaptability, and a resilient attitude to embrace future opportunities and appreciate the value of all occupations.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Cyber Wellness</strong>
<br>With the cyberspace being more accessible to students, Cyber Wellness becomes more important as part of character and citizenship education which take care of the positive well-being of our young Internet users. It involves an understanding of the risks of harmful online behaviours, an awareness of how to protect oneself and other Internet users from such behaviours. The Framework focuses on developing the child’s instinct to protect himself and empower him to take responsibility for his own well-being in cyberspace.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The Cyber Wellness Framework guides schools in planning for a cyber wellness programme.<br>It highlights two principles to guide students in their actions describes a 3-step process to explore cyber wellness issues. The school has already embarked on a cyberwellness programme to help students know how to manage themselves in cyberspace. We hope parents would be able to join us in inculcating the right values to our young.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>CCE Development Protocol</strong>
<br><br>As part of our school’s continued efforts to develop our students holistically, the CCE Development Protocol premised on a set of core values GRACIOUSLY was developed to help our students chart their development of character and citizenship. Values can be manifested through the students’ social and emotional competencies which are qualities and dispositions that will equip students to succeed for life.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Rationale</strong><br>Though families play the most important role in supporting the growth of a child’s citizenship, personal development and character, schools share in these responsibilities as well. As teachers, it is our responsibility to help our students in their character development above academic success. And because what get measured matters, it is important to develop a tool to measure the presence and absence of these values identified.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Tool</strong>
<br>The protocol includes both a CCE Development card and the use of Teacher Student Conference. The card is a formative assessment tool based specifically on teachers’ observations of the student in their daily behaviour and also teachers’ interaction with them. Teachers who are also Character Coaches then use the conference as the opportunities to have meaningful conversations around the development of character. The conference serves as a vehicle for people to talk about character in a rigorous and nuanced manner. Teachers and parents can get to know each student as a whole child before deciding on the best way to help them level up their competencies. Students can also use feedback from the CCE development card to develop self-understanding and to take ownership of their personal growth by planning the next steps to improve.</p>
