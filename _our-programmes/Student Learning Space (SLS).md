<p style="text-align:justify">The SLS can be accessed via the link below: <br><a href="https://vle.learning.moe.edu.sg/mrv/login" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://vle.learning.moe.edu.sg/mrv/login</a></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Your child’s SLS user ID is usually the first 5 characters of his/her full name and last 4 digits of his/ her birth cert or NRIC together with the alphabet, e.g.&nbsp;TANAH2345X.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">If your child cannot remember his/her password for you to log into his/her SLS account, please try the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, click on “Forget Password” and use the password reset link (and getting your child to answer the security questions, or using the email address for password reset to do so)</li> <ul>        
<li>If Step 1 does not work, or the user ID does not work, do contact your child’s Form Teacher for assistance to reset the password/ get the user ID. You may also contact the Form Teacher/ Subject Teacher for assignment-related queries.</li> 
<li>And if Step 2 does not work either, during school operating hours, you may&nbsp;<b style="color:red">contact the school at 6758 5527</b>&nbsp;for assistance.</li>  
	<li>Outside of school operating hours, the SLS Helpdesk may be contacted at&nbsp;<b style="color:red">6702 6513</b>&nbsp;(Mon to Fri, 4pm to 9pm; Sat, 9am-9pm; closed on public holidays) or emailed at <b style="color:red">helpdesk@sls.ufinity.com</b> with your child’s full name, name of school and form class.</li>
