<p style="text-align:justify">Food from the Heart (FFTH) is a non-profit organisation that feeds the needy through its food distribution programme. Chongfu has established a long term partnership with FFTH to organise food donation drives in school to collect food items, which will be included in FFTH food packs for the needy.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The staff helps out with the logistics at FFTH warehouse (e.g. checking for expiry, categorising and packing) for items that will be distributed to FFTH’s beneficiaries as part of Chongfu’s staff Values-in-Action.</p>
