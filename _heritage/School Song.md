<strong><center> Our School Song</center></strong>

We cheer, we sing for our Chongfu. We cheer, we sing for our Chongfu.

Chongfu, Chongfu you are our cradle, you are our protector.

Chongfu, Chongfu you give us light, you give us love and caress.

We shall strive hard to lay down a firm foundation.

We shall study and progress and march towards a beautiful future.

We cheer, we sing for our Chongfu.

We cheer, we sing for our Chongfu.
