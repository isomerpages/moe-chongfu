The Environment Club aims to bring about heightened awareness within the school, of environmental issues. This is achieved through empowering and developing our members to be activists, ambassadors and advocates for conservation and for protecting the environment. As a club, we often carry out upcycling of used items, gardening activities and have brainstorming sessions to solve current environmental problems and prevent new ones. The insights gained during CCA sessions often inspire change in the school’s environmental measures. The club also manages large-scale recycling in school-wide events and leads in the commemoration of events such as the World Earth Day. Our members also participated in various environment-related competitions and workshops.

In recognition of our school’s efforts in promoting environmental awareness within and beyond our school community, we were awarded the prestigious Vanda Miss Joaquim Sustained Achievement Award, the pinnacle award under the SEC-Starhub School Green Awards as well as the North-West Outstanding School Partner Silver Award in 2021.
