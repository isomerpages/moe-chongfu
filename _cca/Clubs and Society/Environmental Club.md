<p style="text-align:justify">The Environment Club aims to bring about heightened awareness within the school, of environmental issues. This is achieved through empowering and
developing our members to be activists, ambassadors and advocates for conservation
and for protecting the environment. As a club, we often carry out upcycling
of used items, gardening activities and have brainstorming sessions to
solve current environmental problems and prevent new ones. The insights
gained during CCA sessions often inspire change in the school’s environmental
measures. The club also manages large-scale recycling in school-wide events
and leads in the commemoration of events such as the World Earth Day. Our
members also participated in various environment-related competitions and
workshops.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">In recognition of our school’s efforts in promoting environmental awareness within and beyond our school community, we were awarded the prestigious
Vanda Miss Joaquim Sustained Achievement Award, the pinnacle award under
the SEC-Starhub School Green Awards as well as the North-West Outstanding
School Partner Silver Award in 2021.</p>
