The Art Club aims to encourage imagination, provide opportunities and encouragement to express oneself freely through play and exploration of various crafts and medium. The purpose of art club is to provide students who have an interest in art, an opportunity to Enjoy and Experience art and craft forms beyond what is offered in the curriculum. It gives students the opportunity to work individually and in groups through the various making art programmes.

Here, students are also exposed to exhibitions, art competitions such as the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) and many more where they can Excel in the respective craft that they are good at. We have a good track record for SYF in all three categories.

The Art Talent Programme (ATP) curriculum that was launched in 2022 aims to develop selected students in their creativity, conceptual thinking and art skills, and thereby develop them as artists and leaders in art. ATP students can expect:

*   An enhanced and focused Art programme during their CCA. (Ceramics and 1 other art form based on interest)
*   A balanced and deeper programme comprising both studio practice, art criticism components and museum curation.
*   Exploring and engaging a range of materials, media and creative processes.
*   Access to specialised studio facilities (eg museum, kilns, etc), equipment and resources.
*   Learning from art industry professionals and skilled practitioners.

*   Opportunities to apply their leadership skills through, CCA open houses, planning, curation and presentation of artworks.  
    Some will also carry out peer teaching for the modules taught.
