Fun and Fitness is a unique sports Co-curricular Activity (CCA) in Chongfu School. This CCA provides our children with the opportunity to learn a variety of sport activities that are fun and uncommon in a school setting. Some of the activities we conduct in school are rollerblading, dart-throwing, golf and taekwondo. We believe that in providing our students with a variety of these sport activities will excite them and develop their interest in sports. In the long run, we hope that our children will pursue one of these sport activities for leisure or even as a competitive sport.

**Teachers-in-Charge:**
 
Mr Andy Soh Lee Ming <br>
