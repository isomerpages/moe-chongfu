The guzheng is a popular traditional Chinese instrument. The junior members meet on Tuesdays while the seniors attend sessions on Fridays. They learn a repertoire of songs and various techniques under the guidance of an instructor. The members learn what a performance entails – the movements, stage directions and help in the setting up of the equipment.

Senior members help junior members improve their skills by encouraging and coaching them, motivating them to work together to put up outstanding performances. The strong team spirit demonstrated has enabled the ensemble to achieve Distinction in the SYF Arts Presentation since 2016. The ensemble was invited to perform at the Istana in 2019 for their Hari Raya Open House.

Opportunities such as promoting and marketing the CCA to the P2s during CCA Open House are provided for senior members to hone their leadership skills as well.
