In our Malay Dance Club, students are exposed to the different genres of both contemporary and traditional dances namely Inang, Joget, Zapin, Asli and Masri. There are various platforms for our students to showcase their talents and hone their art. To date, our students have performed at school events such as National Day and also participated in the Singapore Youth Festival. We hope the practices and exposure will ignite their passion in learning the traditional art of Malay Dance in a supportive environment.
