Our CCA emphasizes on the skills of cooperation and foster perseverance through consistent practice. In our CCA, we hope to instill the values of responsibility, respect and caring towards one another. We also aim to equip students with the right techniques in playing drums and train them for endurance.

A festive drummer can look forward to performing in various school&nbsp;events, such as the&nbsp;national story-telling competition 2022. The teachers-in-charge and the CCA instructor work closely to develop our students to their fullest potential, focusing to develop students’ self-confidence and self-discipline.
