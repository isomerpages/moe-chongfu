Stimulating programmes, involving exciting, challenging, and progressive activities based on interest of young people, incorporating contact with nature, a rich learning environment where simplicity, creatively and discovery come together to provide adventure and challenge. 

A Game with a purpose.

“Scouting is a game for boys, under the leadership of boys, in which elder brothers can give their younger brothers a healthy environment and encourage them to healthy activities such as will help them to develop CITIZENSHIP.”

– Lord Baden-Powell
