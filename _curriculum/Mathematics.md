As the saying goes, “Mathematics is not about numbers, equations, computations or algorithms: it is about understanding. – W. P. Thurston”, hence in Chongfu School, we aim to groom students who are able to think logically, abstractly, critically and creatively. These are the important 21st&nbsp;Century Competencies that we must imbue in our students, so that they can lead a more productive life and be life-long learners.

Mathematics is undeniably part of our daily lives, from making sense of simple information on the whiteboard to making informed decisions about personal finances. Calculations, measurements, interpretation of graphs and analysing statistical data require a good understanding of Math.

<u>The Mathematics Framework</u>

<img src="/images/math1.png" style="width:75%">
The mathematics framework has been a feature of Singapore’s mathematics curriculum since 1990, and is still relevant to date. The central focus of the framework is mathematical problem solving, that is, using mathematics to solve problems.

			<p><u>Chongfu’s Curriculum Focus</u></p>

<p>In Chongfu School, we focus on problem solving, which encompasses skills and functions that are important in our daily lives. We also aim to develop mathematical thinkers who are able to solve real-world problems. In addition, students should be able to understand math through deep learning and mastery. Only with deep understanding will students be able to reason mathematically and apply mathematical concepts to real-life problems. Through our extensive range of math programmes, we hope students will value and enjoy learning mathematics.</p>  
			<u><b>Approach 1:</b>&nbsp;Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA) Approach</u><br>
<img src="/images/math2.png" style="width:80%"><br><p>The CPA Approach is an essential method of teaching Mathematics for mastery. It involves moving from concrete materials to pictorial representations to abstract symbols and problems.<br><br>
Concrete – New concepts are first introduced by acting it out using real objects or manipulatives.<br><br>
Pictorial – The concepts are then further explained using diagrams and pictures.<br><br>
Abstract –Problems are represented using mathematical notation such as numbers and symbols.
</p>
			<u><b>Approach 2:</b>&nbsp;Chongfu Star Approach</u>
<p>The Chongfu STAR approach to maths problem solving is adapted from George Polya’s problem solving process. It is a structured approach aimed to help students in effective problem solving. The STAR approach uses questioning techniques with a variety of questions in each stage to help students gain independence and confidence in solving mathematical problems.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>  

<u><b>Approach 3:</b>&nbsp;4C Approach</u>
<p>The 4C Approach uses both physical and digital manipulatives in learning Math concepts. The approach involves 4 stages.<br><b>
-	Concrete (manipulatives)</b> – manipulatives are used to solve word problems to aid in their understanding and exploration of problem-solving strategies.<br><b>
-	Consolidate (questioning)</b> – questions are crafted to guide students through the problem-solving process.<br><b>-	Concept (making sense)</b> – students make sense of the concept and skills.<br><b>-	Connect (application)</b> – opportunities are given to apply the strategies to similar questions.

			<p><u>Mathematics Games Programme</u></p>

<p>This is probably the part of mathematics where all students look forward to. Math games were initiated to reveal an interesting and enjoyable side to learning math. A range of math games was made available for students to play and apply their mathematical concepts in a fun way. For example, students can play games at the Piece of Mine during their recesses. The games are progressively introduced to students based on their level of complexity.</p>  
<img src="/images/math4.png" style="width:85%">
<p> Examples of the games include Sudoku, Math Warrior, Tangram, Kakuro, Maths Arithmetiq and Math Puzzles.<br>

Tangram was introduced to the Lower Primary students in Chongfu School. Students are required to apply their geometrical math concepts and manipulate the shapes, such that they form a picture. This trains students to be creative and observant.</p>
<img src="/images/math%205.png" style="width:85%">
<p>Students also play an extremely popular game in Japan, Sudoku. They have to solve the puzzle by determining patterns, which develops their cognitive and observation skills. Students are trained to be patient and focussed, which help them to be more disciplined in learning. An inter-class Sudoku Challenge is held every year for students to master the game.</p>

<p>Math Warrior, as the name suggests, grooms students to be champion fighters in math. It was started for P3 students to develop their number sense. Students also learn to count mentally. This is important as it helps build a strong foundation before progressing to more difficult math sums.</p>

<p>For the Upper Primary, students play Math Arithmetiq where they have to create Mathematical equations using scrabble like tiles. This greatly simulates their cognitive minds and encourages them to think on their feet.</p>

<u>Self-Directed Learning (SDL)</u>

<p>We encourage students to take responsibility and initiative of their own learning. They login to these learning sites at least 2-3 times a week to complete assigned e-learning or e-homework. They may also watch videos and study the solutions of difficult math questions. Thus, they practice various mathematical skills in a fun and engaging way.</p>

<p>The recommended websites are students’ learning management portal (LMS) and MonsWorld. MonsWorld has generated many positive feedbacks due to the high variability and quality of the questions set. The students also enjoyed the games.</p>

			<p><u>Math Experiential Learning</u></p>

<p>Students take part in experiential learning activities which lead them to find out that mathematics is part of their daily lives. They also discover the fun and exhilarating side of mathematics. Through these hands-on activities, students develop their thinking skills and apply their mathematical concepts in real-life problems. In addition, they learn to work together as a team and tap on one another’s strengths.</p>

<p><u>Performance Tasks</u></p>

<p>In order to assess if students are able to apply their mathematical concepts in a real-life problem, performance tasks were introduced as part of alternative assessment. Students are required to solve different tasks using manipulatives and record their answers in appropriate mathematical language. Manipulatives include money, cubes, beads and weighing scales. This gives them the opportunity to apply what they have learnt in the mathematics topics. These performance tasks hope to inject fun in learning mathematics through hands-on activities, rather than doing mundane tests.</p>

			<p><u>Parents’ Support for Mathematics (PSM) Programme</u></p>

<p>A parents’ support group was set up in 2007 to individually coach P6 students who find learning math challenging. The primary aim is to better equip these students with basic numeracy skills so that they are more prepared for the upcoming PSLE examinations. Besides imparting math skills, the dedicated tutors also give encouragement and help boost the students’ confidence in solving math problems.</p>

			<u>Progressive Learning for Mathematics (PLM) Programme</u>

<p>It is aimed to build a strong mathematical foundation in our P5 students who find learning maths a challenge. It is a self-directed learning approach with students progressing at their own pace. They begin at a level which he or she is confident and move on to the next level of increasing difficulty when a perfect score is achieved. Teaching videos with explicit explanations and examples are clearly illustrated before students attempt questions on their own. With every worksheet graded by the computer system as soon as they complete, it gives them instant feedback. With constant practice, students will build up their confidence and self-esteem in tackling mathematical questions.</p>
