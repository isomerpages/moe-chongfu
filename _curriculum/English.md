			<p><b>Uninterrupted Sustained Silent Reading (P1-P6)</b><br>  
USSR is a pre-assembly reading programme where students read silently before the commencement of the daily Flag Raising Ceremony. English story books are read from Mondays to Wednesdays while Mother Tongues books are read on Thursdays and Fridays. Through USSR, majority of students are ensured a daily dose of reading of at least 5-15 minutes. Mass reading inculcates in students the importance of reading.</p>


<p><b>Buddy Reading (P1-P4)</b><br>
This programme aims to to help struggling readers to improve their oral reading fluency, word recognition and ultimately raise their reading age to be on par with their peers in the same level, enabling them to participate actively during English lessons and progress well in their language learning. On designated days of the week, students (tutees) arrive earlier in school – 6.50 to 7.10 am, to be tutored in reading. Their peer tutors comprise selected Primary 3 &amp; 4 students, who have been specially selected. Tutees assessed to have improved in terms of oral reading fluency will be deemed suitable for discharge from the programme but will remain closely monitored in their learning.</p>
			

<p><b>MOE’s IREAD Programme (P1-P6)</b><br>
In line with MOE’s reading thrusts, funds have been allocated to purchase varied and interesting titles for students of all levels within the school. These books further complement and add on to what the school library already offers. Through the variety of titles available, students are exposed to a myriad of text-types and writing styles. Students are encouraged to write short synopses and complete interesting post-reading activities e.g. design a bookmark, comment on their favourite character, construct an alternate story ending etc., and these serve as deliverables to the programme.</p>

<b>Show &amp; Tell (P1-P2)</b><br>
<p>To build confidence in public speaking, Show &amp; Tell was introduced as a form of formative assessment for the Lower Primary students, where students are required a bring an item from home and using vivid and precise language, describe why they have chosen the particular item, where they got it from and other relevant information. Students are also taught and encouraged to pose questions to the presenters, honing their listening and thinking skills.</p>

	<b>Chongfu 811 (Radio Station)</b><br> 
<p>To encourage students to share their opinions freely, the Chongfu radio station named Chongfu 811 is established in 2021 and broadcasts are carried out weekly. Anchor student DJs are identified and they helm the sessions weekly. The guests are students who have submitted their interest during open call.</p>

<p>The team also collaborated with Aesthetics Dept to shortlist 3 jingles for the radio station. Students voted via SLS for the winning jingle that became the signature opening for the broadcast.</p>

<p>The dept has received overwhelming response from the students to be guests / DJs and in the competitions / quizzes held, there has been a high level of participation from the students. Teachers said that their charges looked forward to hearing from their peers and joining in the short quizzes.</p>

<b>Modular Writing Packages (P1-P6)</b><br>
<p>What started out as a project for the school’s Learning Circle has been transformed into unique writing packages for the different levels, targeting at improving students’ writing and text comprehension skills. Currently, teachers in the various levels are presented with an ease-of-use writing package that includes lessons ranging from Plot development and Characterisation to writing conventions.</p>

<b>Reflective Journaling (P3-P6)</b><br>
<p>Reflective Journaling allows students to recount and reflect on experiences by stating their emotions, and give their opinions and feelings on events/ issues/ learning, thereby stretching their meta-cognitive skills and ability to make in-depth connections. Through reading their views and thoughts on issues, reflective journalling gives teachers the opportunity to build stronger rapport and forge closer ties with students, strengthening teacher-student relationship.</p>
