### Introduction

The school’s Character and Citizenship Education programmes aim to equip our students with socio-emotional competencies and skills to exercise responsible citizenship so as to become gracious, persevering, confident and resilient leaders of tomorrow.

Anchored on the CCE Framework are our core values GRACIOUSLY, which are interconnected with Social and Emotional Learning (SEL). The values are unpacked as follows:

**优雅 Gracious**  
\-to be polite, kind, pleasant and generous  
**恭敬 Respectful**  
\-to believe in one’s own self-worth and the intrinsic worth of other people  
**成就 Achieving**  
\-to accomplish one’s purpose, attain his goal and to succeed  
**关怀 Caring**  
\-to act with kindness and compassion and contributes to the betterment of the community and the world  
**革新 Innovative**  
\-to be creative and come up with new ideas, new inventions, and new ways of doing things  
**敏锐 Observant**  
\-to be sensitive to the environment and have a keen perception of things  
**团结 United**  
\-to stand together for a common purpose  
**真诚 Sincere**  
\-to be honest and true  
**忠诚 Loyal**  
\-to stay devoted to one’s values and roots  
**朝气 Youthful**  
\-to be vigorous, fresh and energetic

The approach adopted for the Character and Citizenship Education of our students is to develop them in 5 core areas, namely:

**德 Moral** <br>**智 Intellectual** <br> 
**体 Physical** <br>
**群 Social** <br> **美 Aesthetics**

and thereby preparing them for the 21st century.

### CCE Learning Outcomes

CCE is central to the 21st Century Competencies Framework. It emphasizes the interconnectedness of the core values, social and emotional competencies and civic literacy, global awareness and cross-cultural skills that are critical for character and citizenship development of our students.

The learning outcomes of CCE state what we want our students to learn and attain in CCE, and guide the development of the curriculum for CCE.

**CCE Lessons (Mother Tongue)**<br>
CCE Lessons (Mother Tongue) focuses on developing the moral and social well-being of our pupils by helping them acquire and live by the values that guide them to make appropriate decisions. It not only plays a critical role in instilling sound moral values in our pupils so that they will be equipped with knowledge and life skills, it also nurtures them with the correct attitudes so that they will develop into morally upright, caring and responsible individuals and citizens.

Our school has been worked with SHHK Education committee and the other 4 SHHK (Primary) schools to jointly develop lesson package using SHHK graded storybooks to extend and reinforce teaching points aligned with the philosophy of our SHHK’s founder, Mr Tan Kah Kee, whilst maintaining the CCE (MT) syllabus/curriculum that espoused the R3ICH values, namely Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Caring and Harmony,.

**Social and Emotional Learning**<br> 
Programmes are designed and delivered so that students understand and are able to effectively manage the personal and emotional aspects of one’s life. They will learn to understand the importance of relationships with others and be able to effectively manage these relationships. They will acquire skills and knowledge that facilitate life-long learning or prepare them for their future careers. They will also possess skills, knowledge, values and attitudes to lead a healthy lifestyle and meaningful life and be gracious individuals.

**Life Skills Series**<br>
As part of character and citizenship education, the school aims to equip students with relevant life skills to help them deal effectively with demands and challenges of their everyday life. The life skills series in the form of a pamphlet is given to all students to provide basic tips to help them develop their personal growth. This series encompasses thinking skill, social skill, negotiation skill and other life skills.  
A modular approach is adopted to teach SEL-infused Lifeskills to P1 to P6 students in the following areas:

* Social & Mental Health  
* Coping with Changes  
* Camp Survival Skills  
* Friendships  
* Exam Skills  
* How to study  
* Peer Pressure

Teachers as Character Coaches lead students in reflecting and discussing relevant issues and scenarios. Students record their reflections which include knowledge and skills learnt in their journal.

**Cyber Wellness**<br>
With the cyberspace being more accessible to students, Cyber Wellness becomes more important as part of character and citizenship education which take care of the positive well-being of our young Internet users. It involves an understanding of the risks of harmful online behaviours, an awareness of how to protect oneself and other Internet users from such behaviours. The Framework focuses on developing the child’s instinct to protect himself and empower him to take responsibility for his own well-being in cyberspace.

The Cyber Wellness Framework guides schools in planning for a cyber wellness programme.  
It highlights two principles to guide students in their actions describes a 3-step process to explore cyber wellness issues. The school has already embarked on a cyberwellness programme to help students know how to manage themselves in cyberspace. We hope parents would be able to join us in inculcating the right values to our young.

**CCE Development Protocol**<br>  
As part of our school’s continued efforts to develop our students holistically, the CCE Development Protocol premised on a set of core values GRACIOUSLY was developed to help our students chart their development of character and citizenship. Values can be manifested through the students’ social and emotional competencies which are qualities and dispositions that will equip students to succeed for life.

**Rationale**<br> 
Though families play the most important role in supporting the growth of a child’s citizenship, personal development and character, schools share in these responsibilities as well. As teachers, it is our responsibility to help our students in their character development above academic success. And because what get measured matters, it is important to develop a tool to measure the presence and absence of these values identified.

**Tool**<br>
The protocol includes both a CCE Development card and the use of Teacher Student Conference. The card is a formative assessment tool based specifically on teachers’ observations of the student in their daily behaviour and also teachers’ interaction with them. Teachers who are also Character Coaches then use the conference as the opportunities to have meaningful conversations around the development of character. The conference serves as a vehicle for people to talk about character in a rigorous and nuanced manner. Teachers and parents can get to know each student as a whole child before deciding on the best way to help them level up their competencies. Students can also use feedback from the CCE development card to develop self-understanding and to take ownership of their personal growth by planning the next steps to improve.

		<label for="accordion1"><b>Reading Programmes</b></label>  
    <div>  
<b>Uninterrupted Sustained Silent Reading (P1-P6)</b><br>  
<p>USSR is a pre-assembly reading programme where students read silently before the commencement of the daily Flag Raising Ceremony. English story books are read from Mondays to Wednesdays while Mother Tongues books are read on Thursdays and Fridays. Through USSR, majority of students are ensured a daily dose of reading of at least 5-15 minutes. Mass reading inculcates in students the importance of reading.</p>

<b>Buddy Reading (P1-P4)</b><br>  
<p>This programme aims to to help struggling readers to improve their oral reading fluency, word recognition and ultimately raise their reading age to be on par with their peers in the same level, enabling them to participate actively during English lessons and progress well in their language learning. On designated days of the week, students (tutees) arrive earlier in school – 6.50 to 7.10 am, to be tutored in reading. Their peer tutors comprise selected Primary 3 & 4 students, who have been specially selected. Tutees assessed to have improved in terms of oral reading fluency will be deemed suitable for discharge from the programme but will remain closely monitored in their learning.</p>

<b>MOE’s IREAD Programme (P1-P6)</b><br>
<p>In line with MOE’s reading thrusts, funds have been allocated to purchase varied and interesting titles for students of all levels within the school. These books further complement and add on to what the school library already offers. Through the variety of titles available, students are exposed to a myriad of text-types and writing styles. Students are encouraged to write short synopses and complete interesting post-reading activities e.g. design a bookmark, comment on their favourite character, construct an alternate story ending etc., and these serve as deliverables to the programme.</p>

<b>Nursery Rhymes/ Poetry Recitation (P1-P2)</b>  
<p>Having been exposed to the diverse collections of nursery rhymes and poems in their STELLAR learning units, students are encouraged to use their recite them in class, sometimes using props and other resources to complement their presentation.</p>

<b>Spelling Bee (P3-P4)</b>  <br>
<p>With its concept thought to have originated from the United States, a Spelling Bee is a competition where contestants are asked to verbally spell English words. At our school level, top spellers are carefully selected to represent their classes in an intra-school competition. With this programme in mind, the department also hopes to cultivate good reading habits, one which leads to vocabulary acquisition – over mere rote learning of words. Oracy skills are also enhanced in the spelling process as student-participants are required to express their thoughts in words.</p>  
<img src="/images/cce5.png" style="width: 50%">>
<b>Show & Tell (P1-P2)</b>
<p>To build confidence in public speaking, Show & Tell was introduced as a form of formative assessment for the Lower Primary students, where students are required a bring an item from home and using vivid and precise language, describe why they have chosen the particular item, where they got it from and other relevant information. Students are also taught and encouraged to pose questions to the presenters, honing their listening and thinking skills.</p>
<img src="/images/cce%207.png" style="width:50%">
<b>Airtime (P3-P6)</b>  
<p>An extension to Show & Tell, the Middle and Upper Primary students are encouraged to speak freely and critically for about two minutes on a given topic, without assistance or prompts from teachers. Topics range from local, international current affairs to issues pertaining to their personal lives. This ensures that students are kept abreast of the latest news happenings and further provides a platform for meaningful sharing and interaction in the classroom.</p>

<b>Podcasting (P1-P6)</b>
<p>A new initiative launched by the department, for all levels, to complement the upcoming C2015 Curriculum. Students are exposed to Podcasting, one of many multimodal ICT tools, as a way to enhance their active listening skills.</p>

<b>Modular Writing Packages (P1-P6)</b>
<p>What started out as a project for the school’s Learning Circle has been transformed into unique writing packages for the different levels, targeting at improving students’ writing and text comprehension skills. Currently, teachers in the various levels are presented with an ease-of-use writing package that includes lessons ranging from Plot development and Characterisation to writing conventions.</p>

<b>Reflective Journaling (P3-P6)</b>
<p>Reflective Journaling allows students to recount and reflect on experiences by stating their emotions, and give their opinions and feelings on events/ issues/ learning, thereby stretching their meta-cognitive skills and ability to make in-depth connections. Through reading their views and thoughts on issues, reflective journalling gives teachers the opportunity to build stronger rapport and forge closer ties with students, strengthening teacher-student relationship.</p>

<b>Theatrical Exposure and Experience</b>
<p>To inculcate in pupils the love and passion for the learning and appreciation of the English Language through literature and arts, P1-P6 students will have the opportunity to attend plays appropriate to their respective age groups. Through such exposure, students will get to experience creative expression of language arts.</p>
