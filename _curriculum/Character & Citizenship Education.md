### Introduction

The school’s Character and Citizenship Education programmes aim to equip our students with socio-emotional competencies and skills to exercise responsible citizenship so as to become gracious, persevering, confident and resilient leaders of tomorrow.

Anchored on the CCE Framework are our core values GRACIOUSLY, which are interconnected with Social and Emotional Learning (SEL). The values are unpacked as follows:

**优雅 Gracious**  
\-to be polite, kind, pleasant and generous  
**恭敬 Respectful**  
\-to believe in one’s own self-worth and the intrinsic worth of other people  
**成就 Achieving**  
\-to accomplish one’s purpose, attain his goal and to succeed  
**关怀 Caring**  
\-to act with kindness and compassion and contributes to the betterment of the community and the world  
**革新 Innovative**  
\-to be creative and come up with new ideas, new inventions, and new ways of doing things  
**敏锐 Observant**  
\-to be sensitive to the environment and have a keen perception of things  
**团结 United**  
\-to stand together for a common purpose  
**真诚 Sincere**  
\-to be honest and true  
**忠诚 Loyal**  
\-to stay devoted to one’s values and roots  
**朝气 Youthful**  
\-to be vigorous, fresh and energetic

The approach adopted for the Character and Citizenship Education of our students is to develop them in 5 core areas, namely:

**德 Moral** <br>**智 Intellectual** <br> 
**体 Physical** <br>
**群 Social** <br> **美 Aesthetics**

and thereby preparing them for the 21st century.

### CCE Learning Outcomes

CCE is central to the 21st Century Competencies Framework. It emphasizes the interconnectedness of the core values, social and emotional competencies and civic literacy, global awareness and cross-cultural skills that are critical for character and citizenship development of our students.

The learning outcomes of CCE state what we want our students to learn and attain in CCE, and guide the development of the curriculum for CCE.

<img src="/images/cce1.png" 
     style="width:70%">
		 
Our tagline for student leadership is Every Chongfu student, A Leader advocates that Chongfu students are leaders who are able to lead, motivate and inspire others. They are confident, innovative and possess the courage and conviction to stand firm in overcoming challenges and obstacles. Under Personal and Social development, Chongfu students are taught to be gracious and socially responsible. They work effectively in teams and care for the community and the environment. They continually strive for excellence and take pride in all they do.

With good citizenship education, every Chongfu child appreciates cultural differences and good governance. We want our Chongfu students to possess a sense of belonging to the home, school, community and Singapore.

With the aim to develop gracious, patriotic and global thinkers, the CCE programmes are specially tailored.
