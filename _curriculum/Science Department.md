### Curriculum Framework

     style="width:50%">
Central to the curriculum framework is the inculcation of the spirit of scientific inquiry. The conduct of inquiry is founded on three integral domains of (a) Knowledge, Understanding and Application, (b) Skills and Processes and (c) Ethics and Attitudes. The focus for the department is the domain of **Skills and Processes.**

### Curriculum Approach : Inquiry-based Learning

Inquiry-based Science instruction engages students in the processes of formulating predictions, organising and interpreting data, and communicating results using Science terminology. The approach has great potential to excite and motivate students, appeals to students’ natural curiosity about the world around them, while developing Science process skills.  
Inquiry-based Learning involves the following 5Es:

* Engage : To make connections between past and present learning experiences (to assess students’ prior knowledge)  
* Explore : To provide a common learning experience for students to begin developing an understanding  
* Explain : To connect to previous experiences and begin to make conceptual sense by developing an explanation  
* Elaborate: To expand on the concepts learnt, make connections to other related concepts and apply understanding to the world around us  
* Evaluate : To determine/assess if the students have attained understanding of concepts and knowledge

### Holistic Assessment

In Chongfu School, we believe that a sound Science curriculum not only prepares pupils for the national exams but also equips them with the competencies and right attitudes which would ensure that they are adequately proficient to contribute in this technologically-driven world.

Programmes are designed to develop pupils in the various domains and holistic assessment tasks are crafted to monitor pupils’ progress. Each holistic assessment task is carefully aligned to the department’s learning outcomes and serves as a planning document for future instruction. To assess attitudes and skills, tasks beyond pen and paper have been designed with varied modes of feedback.

The following are examples of Science holistic tasks:  
– Concept Cartoons  
– Spelling  
– Lab Work  
– Practical Tests  
– Projects

### Excellence 2000 (E2K) Science Programme for P4 to P6

Chongfu School is working with the Gifted Education Branch, Ministry of Education (MOE) to pilot an enrichment programme to cater to high progress learners in Science in primary schools.

This programme, known as the Excellence 2000 (E2K) Science Programme, is based on a curriculum for talented students in Israel. The instructional methodology and materials are designed to be relevant to the learners’ lives, with a strong focus on process and thinking skills in Science. They are aimed at stimulating curiosity while developing and strengthening abilities to study phenomena and their possible causes. Through the programme, we want to motivate the learners to be confident and independent researchers in their own right.

### Chongfu's Green Efforts

Chongfu School has always been committed in doing her part for the environment. Besides being actively involved in newspaper recycling projects, the school promotes environmental messages through assembly talks, activities in conjunction with international environmental events and student-led activities organised by the Environmental Club. Through all these exposure, students acquire understanding of environmentally-friendly habits and learn to take care of the environment.
