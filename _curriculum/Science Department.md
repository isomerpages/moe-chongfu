### Our Vision

Our students are diverse, with different needs, interests and aptitudes for Science. In line with MOE’s Science curriculum framework, we seek to,

1.  **enthuse** and nurture all students to be scientifically literate, so that they are able to make informed decisions and  
    take responsible actions in their daily lives; and  
2.  **provide** strong Science fundamentals for students to innovate and pursue STEM for their future learning and work.

### BSCS 5E Instructional Model and Inquiry-Based Learning

We use the **BSCS 5E Instructional Model** for the teaching and learning of Science. Using this model, the learning experience is sequenced to enable learners to construct their understanding of a science key concept over time. Each phase of the learning sequence can be described using five words that begin with E: engage, explore, explain, elaborate, and evaluate.

**Inquiry-based Science instruction** engages students in the processes of formulating predictions, organising and interpreting data, and communicating results using Science terminology.

In the use of these approaches to design Science lessons, we seek to inculcate in students a **sense of curiosity and wonderment** about the things around them. We strive to provide opportunities for them to **relate scientific concepts to real-life phenomena** and to encourage them to **ask questions about the world around them.** With these, the learning of Science will then become more meaningful and joyful.

We hope that our students would be **inspired by Science,** and have opportunities to **inquire like Scientists** such that they will be empowered to **innovate using Science** to solve problems of the future.

### Science Curriculum and Holistic Assessment

The Science curriculum is implemented in the classroom through teacher-facilitated hands-on activities, experiments and discussion. Where meaningful, students also practise Thinking Routines such as **“I See – I Think – I Wonder”** during the inquiry process and **“Claim – Evidence – Reasoning”** when giving scientific explanations.

The learning activities are designed to develop pupils in various domains and holistic assessment tasks are crafted to monitor pupils’ progress. Each holistic assessment task is carefully aligned to learning outcomes and students’ performance will inform teachers of the intervention required. To assess attitudes and skills, tasks beyond the traditional pen and paper tests have been designed. Some examples of Science holistic tasks include:

– Model-making projects

– Concept Cartoons

– Performance tasks

		<label for="accordion1"><b>1. Environment Education @ Chongfu</b></label>
    <div>
      <p>Chongfu School stands committed to doing our part for the environment and in actively nurturing our students to learn, practise and contribute to a sustainable Singapore.</p>

<p>Beyond the Science, and CCE core curricula which have integrated the teaching and learning of sustainability concepts, the Science department is working to <b>advocate for sustainability practices that students can adopt as daily habits</b> such as saving energy and water and reducing food waste. This strengthens the importance of sustainability as an integral part of our culture. Some of the activities conducted as part of Environment Education include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>school-wide newspaper recycling project;</li>
	<li>assembly talks;</li>
	<li>activities in conjunction with international environmental events;</li>
	<li>student-led activities organised by the Environmental Club CCA and the Prefectorial Board;</li>
	<li>upcycling projects; and</li>
	<li>Design Thinking projects (tie in with the ALP)</li>
			</ul>
<p>Through the years, we have received several awards for our sustained environmental efforts.</p>

<p>The Science department partners with our parent volunteers in the maintenance of the Eco garden. Where possible, the school also strives to leverage community partnerships to offer students more environment-related learning opportunities, and a better understanding of future “green jobs.” Our sustained efforts to collaborate with and contribute to the North West community have been recognised through our achievement of the Outstanding School Partner Awards through the years.</p>

    <div>
      <p>Chongfu’s Grace is an outdoor learning space which is equipped with Science toys, an indoor nursery, and eco-friendly features such as solar panels that power the fans and lights, a rainwater harvesting tank with an auto-irrigation function, and a green wall.</p>

<p>The department provide exciting opportunities for students to engage in science-based unstructured play and exploration with their peers during recess at Chongfu’s Grace. Some of these activities students could do include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>playing with Science toys;</li>
	<li>the active exploration of the Eco garden; and</li>
	<li>performing self-directed experiments.</li>
			</ul>
<p>These experiences allow opportunities for incidental learning and can spark interest in the learning of Science.</p>

    <div>
      <p>Chongfu School works closely with the Gifted Education Branch (MOE) in piloting and implementing an enrichment programme known as the Excellence 2000 (E2K) Science Programme. This programme is for selected students who demonstrate strong interest and aptitude in Science.</p>

<p>This is based on a curriculum for talented students in Israel. The instructional methodology and materials are designed to be relevant to the learners’ lives, with a strong focus on process and thinking skills in Science. They are aimed at stimulating curiosity while developing and strengthening abilities to study phenomena and their possible causes.</p>

<p>Just as scientists make mistakes in the real world, E2K Science students are encouraged to be broad-thinking, adventurous and not be afraid to make mistakes in their investigations. Through the programme, we motivate the learners to be confident and independent researchers in their own right. Students are also given the opportunity to share their interest areas and learning with the school by virtual science busking.</p>
