### Our Vision

Our students are diverse, with different needs, interests and aptitudes for Science. In line with MOE’s Science curriculum framework, we seek to,

1.  **enthuse** and nurture all students to be scientifically literate, so that they are able to make informed decisions and  
    take responsible actions in their daily lives; and  
2.  **provide** strong Science fundamentals for students to innovate and pursue STEM for their future learning and work.

### BSCS 5E Instructional Model and Inquiry-Based Learning**

We use the **BSCS 5E Instructional Model** for the teaching and learning of Science. Using this model, the learning experience is sequenced to enable learners to construct their understanding of a science key concept over time. Each phase of the learning sequence can be described using five words that begin with E: engage, explore, explain, elaborate, and evaluate.

**Inquiry-based Science instruction** engages students in the processes of formulating predictions, organising and interpreting data, and communicating results using Science terminology.

In the use of these approaches to design Science lessons, we seek to inculcate in students a **sense of curiosity and wonderment** about the things around them. We strive to provide opportunities for them to **relate scientific concepts to real-life phenomena** and to encourage them to **ask questions about the world around them.** With these, the learning of Science will then become more meaningful and joyful.

We hope that our students would be **inspired by Science,** and have opportunities to **inquire like Scientists** such that they will be empowered to **innovate using Science** to solve problems of the future.
