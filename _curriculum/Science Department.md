     style="width:50%">
Central to the curriculum framework is the inculcation of the spirit of scientific inquiry. The conduct of inquiry is founded on three integral domains of (a) Knowledge, Understanding and Application, (b) Skills and Processes and (c) Ethics and Attitudes. The focus for the department is the domain of **Skills and Processes.**

### Curriculum Approach : Inquiry-based Learning

Inquiry-based Science instruction engages students in the processes of formulating predictions, organising and interpreting data, and communicating results using Science terminology. The approach has great potential to excite and motivate students, appeals to students’ natural curiosity about the world around them, while developing Science process skills.  
Inquiry-based Learning involves the following 5Es:

* Engage : To make connections between past and present learning experiences (to assess students’ prior knowledge)  
* Explore : To provide a common learning experience for students to begin developing an understanding  
* Explain : To connect to previous experiences and begin to make conceptual sense by developing an explanation  
* Elaborate: To expand on the concepts learnt, make connections to other related concepts and apply understanding to the world around us  
* Evaluate : To determine/assess if the students have attained understanding of concepts and knowledge
