			<p><b>Uninterrupted Sustained Silent Reading (P1-P6)</b><br>  
USSR is a pre-assembly reading programme where students read silently before the commencement of the daily Flag Raising Ceremony. English story books are read from Mondays to Wednesdays while Mother Tongues books are read on Thursdays and Fridays. Through USSR, majority of students are ensured a daily dose of reading of at least 5-15 minutes. Mass reading inculcates in students the importance of reading.</p>


<p><b>Buddy Reading (P1-P4)</b><br>
This programme aims to to help struggling readers to improve their oral reading fluency, word recognition and ultimately raise their reading age to be on par with their peers in the same level, enabling them to participate actively during English lessons and progress well in their language learning. On designated days of the week, students (tutees) arrive earlier in school – 6.50 to 7.10 am, to be tutored in reading. Their peer tutors comprise selected Primary 3 & 4 students, who have been specially selected. Tutees assessed to have improved in terms of oral reading fluency will be deemed suitable for discharge from the programme but will remain closely monitored in their learning.</p>
			

<p><b>MOE’s IREAD Programme (P1-P6)</b><br>
In line with MOE’s reading thrusts, funds have been allocated to purchase varied and interesting titles for students of all levels within the school. These books further complement and add on to what the school library already offers. Through the variety of titles available, students are exposed to a myriad of text-types and writing styles. Students are encouraged to write short synopses and complete interesting post-reading activities e.g. design a bookmark, comment on their favourite character, construct an alternate story ending etc., and these serve as deliverables to the programme.</p>

<b>Nursery Rhymes/ Poetry Recitation (P1-P2)</b><br>  
<p>Having been exposed to the diverse collections of nursery rhymes and poems in their STELLAR learning units, students are encouraged to use their recite them in class, sometimes using props and other resources to complement their presentation.</p>

<b>Spelling Bee (P3-P4)</b><br>
<p>With its concept thought to have originated from the United States, a Spelling Bee is a competition where contestants are asked to verbally spell English words. At our school level, top spellers are carefully selected to represent their classes in an intra-school competition. With this programme in mind, the department also hopes to cultivate good reading habits, one which leads to vocabulary acquisition – over mere rote learning of words. Oracy skills are also enhanced in the spelling process as student-participants are required to express their thoughts in words.</p>

<b>Show & Tell (P1-P2)</b><br>
<p>To build confidence in public speaking, Show & Tell was introduced as a form of formative assessment for the Lower Primary students, where students are required a bring an item from home and using vivid and precise language, describe why they have chosen the particular item, where they got it from and other relevant information. Students are also taught and encouraged to pose questions to the presenters, honing their listening and thinking skills.</p>

     style="width:50%">
<b>Airtime (P3-P6)</b> 
<p>An extension to Show & Tell, the Middle and Upper Primary students are encouraged to speak freely and critically for about two minutes on a given topic, without assistance or prompts from teachers. Topics range from local, international current affairs to issues pertaining to their personal lives. This ensures that students are kept abreast of the latest news happenings and further provides a platform for meaningful sharing and interaction in the classroom.</p>

<b>Podcasting (P1-P6)</b><br>  
<p>A new initiative launched by the department, for all levels, to complement the upcoming C2015 Curriculum. Students are exposed to Podcasting, one of many multimodal ICT tools, as a way to enhance their active listening skills.</p>

<b>Modular Writing Packages (P1-P6)</b><br>
<p>What started out as a project for the school’s Learning Circle has been transformed into unique writing packages for the different levels, targeting at improving students’ writing and text comprehension skills. Currently, teachers in the various levels are presented with an ease-of-use writing package that includes lessons ranging from Plot development and Characterisation to writing conventions.</p>

<b>Reflective Journaling (P3-P6)</b><br>
<p>Reflective Journaling allows students to recount and reflect on experiences by stating their emotions, and give their opinions and feelings on events/ issues/ learning, thereby stretching their meta-cognitive skills and ability to make in-depth connections. Through reading their views and thoughts on issues, reflective journalling gives teachers the opportunity to build stronger rapport and forge closer ties with students, strengthening teacher-student relationship.</p>
