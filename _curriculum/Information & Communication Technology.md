### Introduction

The ICT vision of the school is to create a community of learners actively using ICT. One of the objectives is to provide pupils with opportunities to access, process and communicate information effectively. In line with this objective, a carefully designed programme is created to promote ICT literacy for our pupils in Chongfu. This learning path exposes the children to a world of information technology in a systematic and interesting way. Each level is tailored to each primary standard and on its completion serves as a prerequisite to the next level.

By the time our pupils leave Chongfu after PSLE, they would have acquired the necessary skills to prepare them for more challenging IT required projects or courses in the secondary and beyond.  
With today’s emphasis on technology, it is imperative that our pupils have a head start in ICT. But true education means that it is necessary to venture beyond coverage of the curriculum. These ICT programmes will stimulate in the pupils an appreciation of ICT as the key to unlocking the wonders of our world and as a learning tool that can open doors to infinite opportunities. It will also provide the skills necessary for the pupils to be ICT competent learners and leaders in the future.

<p>In view of the possible outbreak of a flu pandemic and that schools need to close (after consultation with MOH), MOE and schools are required to ensure that students remain engaged in learning during school closure, particularly through the use of online learning platforms. Hence, as part of our preparation for this online learning, the school conducts regular E-Learning Exercises. <br>
On the day of the exercises, our pupils were not required to report to school. They were instead doing online learning tasks and assignments from home via Student Learning Space.  <br>
Families with no PC or internet access at home could access internet at the National Libraries or share PCs with their friends. Through this e-learning exercise, our children were more prepared should there be a need to close the school as our pupils embark on this enriching online learning experience.</p>
