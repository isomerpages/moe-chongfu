&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>For Science WANDer, students presented magic tricks to the school during morning assembly. In one instance, the student magicians demonstrated how an egg could be pushed into a bottle using differences in air pressure. They then linked this to the experience of getting “airplane ears” while on a plane.</p>
