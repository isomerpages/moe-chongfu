**Learning Journey – Pongal Festival**

Our Tamil pupils go on a Learning Journey to Little India to witness the celebration of Pongal Festival, during which Hindus all over the world offer their gratitude to the sun. Though an annual affair for Hindus, in 2014, non-Indian pupils also participated in the learning Journey to Little India as a form of National Education.

Pupils had the opportunity to immerse themselves in Indian tradition, understanding the significance of celebrating Pongal and also taking part in activities like applying henna to their hands and buying Indian sweets. The Learning Journey to Pongal Festival was indeed an interesting and enriching experience for our pupils.

**Tamil Fortnight Activities 2014**  <br>
‘Mother Tongue Fortnight Activities’ is an initiative introduced by MOE with the objectives of educating and engaging our pupils in the Tamil Language and Culture. Over the span of these two weeks, our pupils will be engaged in several cultural activities such as going on Learning journeys, participating in language competitions and attending cultural camps. These activities would serve as enrichment to our pupils’ language learning. In 2014, our pupils had the privilege to attend a half day cultural camp conducted by external vendors. In this camp, pupils learnt the significance of yoga in the Indian culture. This also helped students with eye, mental and physical health. They also had hands-on activities such as thoranam- weaving, playing of traditional Indian board games and coconut leaf art. It was an informative and fun-filled camp for the pupils. Apart from the cultural camp, our Tamil pupils also had cultural activities in the classroom level conducted by their respective Tamil Language teachers.
