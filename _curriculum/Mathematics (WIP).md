_“Making Math Simple, Making Math Fun and Making Math Meaningful.”_

*   **Math Made Simple**
    *   Strong Basics
        *   Mastering concepts & skills _at different_ developmental stages
        *   Developing strategies and approach to solving Math problems
*   **Math Made Fun**
    *   Early Success
        *   Building students’ confidence + motivation
        *   Cultivating interest in Math learning

*   **Math Made Meaningful**
    *   Steady Progress
        *   Developing students’ learning with understanding
        *   Providing meaningful learning experience
   
As the saying goes, “Mathematics is not about numbers, equations, computations or algorithms: it is about understanding. – W. P. Thurston”, hence in Chongfu School, we aim to groom students who are able to think logically, abstractly, critically and creatively. These are the important 21st Century Competencies that we must imbue in our students, so that they can lead a more productive life and be life-long learners.

Mathematics is undeniably part of our daily lives, from making sense of simple information on the whiteboard to making informed decisions about personal finances. Calculations, measurements, interpretation of graphs and analysing statistical data require a good understanding of Math.

<u>The Mathematics Framework</u>

The mathematics framework has been a feature of Singapore’s mathematics curriculum since 1990, and is still relevant to date. The central focus of the framework is mathematical problem solving, that is, using mathematics to solve problems.

			<p><u>Chongfu’s Curriculum Focus</u></p>

<p>In Chongfu School, we focus on problem solving, where it encompasses skills and functions that are important in our daily lives. We also aim to develop mathematical thinkers who are able to solve real-world problems. In addition, students should be able to understand math by having deep learning and mastery. Only with deep understanding, can students be able to reason mathematically and apply their mathematical concepts to real-life problems. Through our extensive range of math programmes, we hope students will value and enjoy learning mathematics.</p>

			<u><b>Approach 2:</b> Chongfu Star Approach</u>
<p>The Chongfu STAR approach to maths problem solving is adapted from George Polya’s problem solving process. It is a structured approach aimed to help students in effective problem solving. The STAR approach uses questioning techniques with a variety of questions in each stage to help students gain independence and confidence in solving mathematical problems.</p>

			<p><u>Mathematics Games Programme</u></p>

<p>This is probably the part of mathematics where all students look forward to. Math games were initiated to reveal an interesting and enjoyable side to learning math. A range of math games was made available for students to play and apply their mathematical concepts in a fun way. For example, students can play games at the Piece of Mine during their recesses. The games are progressively introduced to students based on their level of complexity.</p>
