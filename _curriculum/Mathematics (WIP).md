As the saying goes, “Mathematics is not about numbers, equations, computations or algorithms: it is about understanding. – W. P. Thurston”, hence in Chongfu School, we aim to groom students who are able to think logically, abstractly, critically and creatively. These are the important 21st Century Competencies that we must imbue in our students, so that they can lead a more productive life and be life-long learners.

Mathematics is undeniably part of our daily lives, from making sense of simple information on the whiteboard to making informed decisions about personal finances. Calculations, measurements, interpretation of graphs and analysing statistical data require a good understanding of Math.
