**Student Learning Space (SLS) Support**

The SLS can be accessed from [https://learning.moe.edu.sg](https://learning.moe.edu.sg/).

Your child’s SLS user ID is usually the first 5 characters of his/her full name and last 4 digits of his/ her birth cert or NRIC together with the alphabet, e.g. _TANAH2345X._

If your child cannot remember his/her password for you to log into his/her SLS account, please try the following:

1.  First, click on “Forget Password” and use the password reset link (and getting your child to answer the security questions, or using the email address for password reset to do so)  
        

*   If Step 1 does not work, or the user ID does not work, do contact your child’s Form Teacher for assistance to reset the password/ get the user ID. You may also contact the Form Teacher/ Subject Teacher for assignment-related queries.  
    

*   And if Step 2 does not work either, during school operating hours, you may **contact the school at 6758 5527** for assistance.  
    

*   Outside of school operating hours, the SLS Helpdesk may be contacted at **6702 6513** (Mon to Fri, 4pm to 9pm; Sat, 9am-9pm; closed on public holidays) or emailed at helpdesk@sls.ufinity.com with your child’s full name, name of school and form class.
