Dear P1 Parents,

Welcome to our Chongfu family.

Primary school is an important milestone of your child’s educational journey. We aim to partner you in building your child’s cognitive growth and character development as we journey together through a variety of learning experiences for the next 6 years.

To facilitate a smooth transition on the first day of school, please log on to Parent Gateway

1.  To know more about the administrative matters for the first day of school
2.  To key in your responses for the mode of dismissal

Best regards,

Mdm Nur Lailie<br>
Assistant Year Head – P1 (2022)
