### Congratulations, Chongfu School in Top 50 Winner list

The SOTA Primary 6 Art Competition was launched in 2018 as one of SOTA’s outreach programmes to encourage and provide a platform for young artists to express their creativity and hone their talents in Visual Arts, and has since become an annual nation-wide drawing and painting competition. Chongfu School uses this platform to expose our Primary 6 students who excel in art to participate in this visual arts competition to showcase their creativity and imagination. The theme for 2023 is "If I Can Change The World".   

We would like to share that Hoo Zi Cheng Leanne (6 Respectful) titled Candyland has been selected as one of the top 50 Finalists in SOTA’s Primary 6 Art Competition 2023.
