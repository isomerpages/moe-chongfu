# 3rd June 2022

Girl Guides Singapore International Camp 2022 was graced by both our President Halimah Yacob and Minister of State, Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth & Ministry of Trade and Industry, Ms Low Yen Ling. The theme for this year is “She can!” – anchored on the belief that girls can do anything.

42 of our P4 and P5 Brownies are currently attending the virtual camp and 2 of our school Brownies, Liu Mingxuan (5 Respectful) and Lim Wen Jun, Danielle (5 Achieving) will be involved in the closing ceremony of this event on 4th June 2022.

We are proud of our Brownies and we thank our teachers, parents and community for their continued support of our students.
