<p style="text-align:justify">Earth Day, celebrated annually on 22 April, reminds us about the urgent need to address environmental challenges our planet faces.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">This year, we dedicated an entire week in April to increase students' awareness on the urgent need to tackle plastic pollution and safeguard our ecosystems. This is in alignment with this year's theme, ‘Planet vs Plastics.’ Our students were engaged in various activities and competitions to raise their awareness on the urgency of the environmental problems faced by our planet today, and what they could do to help. We would like to invite you to join us in commemorating this important occasion by engaging in discussions with your child and in implementing eco-friendly practices at home.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Together, let's make a positive impact for a greener and healthier planet. Make every day Earth Day!</p>
